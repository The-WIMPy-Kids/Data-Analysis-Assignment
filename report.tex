	\subsection{\color{MidnightBlue} Multivariate Gaussian Distribution}
		The problem involves 2 correlated Gaussian random variables x and y with 0 mean.
		\\ Their covariance matrix is given by : \\
		$ \begin{array}{c} C \end{array} = \left [\begin{array}{c c}\sigma _{x}^{2} & \sigma _{xy} \\\sigma _{xy} & \sigma _{y}^			{2}\end{array} \right ] = \left [\begin{array}{c c} 9 & -2 \\-2 & 6\end{array} \right ] $
		\subsubsection{\color{RoyalBlue} Contour Plot}
			The contour plot obtained for the probability distribution function of x and y is : \\
			\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{contour} \\
			The contours are ellipses with their major axes inclined to the positive X axis at an obtuse angle beacause of the 				negative correlation between the two random variables. \\
			The eigenvalue equation for matrix C is $ (6-\lambda)(9-\lambda)-4=0 $ \\
			The eigenvalues are 5 and 10 for which the corresponding eigenvectors can be found. After normalization the
			eigenvectors are :

			$ \begin{array}{c} x^{'} \end{array} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left [\begin{array}{c} 2\\-1 \end{array} \right ] $
			$ \begin{array}{c} y^{'} \end{array} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left [\begin{array}{c} 1\\2 \end{array} \right ] $ \\
			Hence the major axes of the ellipses are along $ x+2y=0 $ and the minor axes are along $ 2x-y=0 . $

		\subsubsection{\color{RoyalBlue} 2D Histogram of random pairs generated from the distribution}
			50000 pairs of random numbers (x,y) having this distribution were generated and a 2D histogram was plotted. \\
			\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{hist} \\
			250 bins were cosidered for plotting the histogram. The height of the histogram is shown using the color scheme 			`Inferno'. \\
			The maximum number of points in the 2D histogram are towards the center (0,0) and decreases as we move outward.
			The height of the histogram at various points is clearly in agreement with the contour diagram.

		\subsubsection{\color{RoyalBlue} Distribution of z}
			A new variable z is generated for each of the 50000 pairs of x and y that are generated.
			$ z = \frac{1}{50} (6x^2 + 4xy + 9y^2) $ \\
			A histogram is plotted for the values of z. \\
			\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{hist2} \\
			The new variables x' and y' have a covariance matrix :
			$ \begin{array}{c} C' \end{array} = \left [\begin{array}{c c} 10 & 0 \\0 & 5\end{array} \right ] $
			Let a new variable w be given by
			$ w = \frac{{x'}^2}{10} + \frac{{y'}^2}{5} $
			w is a sum of squares of Gaussian distributed variables divided by the sum of their respective variances and hence 				is chi-squared distributed. On substituting values of x' and y'(i.e in terms of x and y), w simplifies to z.
			Hence z has a $ \chi^2 $ distribution which is confirmed by the histogram. \\
			The mean value of z is 2.00651469681 with a standard deviation of 2.00418289914.

	\subsection{\color{MidnightBlue} Panda Statistics}
		The weight of 100 baby pandas is read from the file \emph{"pandas.txt"} and stored in an array.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The mean weight of the pandas is calculated to be \textbf{49.41660999999994} with an error(standard deviation) of 			\textbf{10.210954715603448}.
		\item The size of typical fluctuations of the weight of each baby panda about the mean is calculated by summing up the 				modulus value of the difference of each individual weight from the sample mean and dividing it by the number of 			pandas under consideration. This value works out to be \textbf{8.110777120000005}.

		The readings of the length of an aluminium rod as a function of temperature is read from the file
		\emph{"linearexpansion.csv"}.

		\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{scatter} \\
		
		\subsubsection{\color{RoyalBlue} Best Fit Line}
		Let us consider y=mx+c as the equation for the best-fit line. Analytically the value of m and c can be found: \\
		$ SS = \sum_{i=0}^{n}(y_{i}-(mx_{i}+c))^{2} 
		$
		\\ \\
		where SS is the sum of squares. \\ \\
		$
		\frac{\partial SS}{\partial m} = 0
		\Rightarrow  \sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i}(y_{i}-(mx_{i}+c)) = 0 \\ \\
		\frac{\partial SS}{\partial c} = 0 
		\Rightarrow  \sum_{i=0}^{n} (y_{i}-(mx_{i}+c)) = 0 \\ \\
		\sum_{i=0}^{n} y_{i} = m\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i} + Nc \\ \\
		\Rightarrow c = \overline{y} - m\overline{x} \\ \\
		\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i}y_{i} = m\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i}^{2} + Nc\overline{x} \\ \\
		\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i}y_{i} = m\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i}^{2} + N\overline{x}(\overline{y}-m\overline{x}) \\ \\
		m = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i}y_{i} - \overline{x} \sum_{i=0}^{n} y_{i}} {\sum_{i=0}^{n} x^{2}_{i} - N\overline{x}^{2}} \\ 
		$
		\\
		Let $ \sigma $ be the single measurement error for each y \\
		$
		 \sigma ^{2}_{m} = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n} ((x_{i} - \overline{x})^{2} \sigma^ {2}_{yi}} {\sum_{i=0}^{n} {x_{i}^{2} -
		 N\overline{x}^{2}}^{2}} \\ \\
		\sigma ^{2}_{m} = \frac{\sigma ^{2}} {(\sum_{i=0}^{n} x^{2}_{i}) - N\overline{x}^{2}} \\ \\
		c=\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n} y_{i}}{N} - m\overline{x} \\ \\
		\sigma ^{2}_{c} = \frac{1}{N^{2}} \sum_{i=0}^{n}(\sigma _{yi}^{2} + \overline{x} ^{2} \sigma ^{2}_{m} \\ \\
		\sigma ^{2}_{c} = \frac{\sigma ^{2}}{N} + \overline{x} ^{2} \sigma ^{2}_{m} \\ \\
		$
		Let $ x_{0} $ be the temparature at extrapolated point and $ y_{0} $ be the extrapolated length. Then \\ 
		$
		\sigma ^{2}_{y_{0}} = x^{2}_{0}\sigma ^{2}_{m} + \sigma ^{2}_{c}
		\sigma ^{2}_{y_{0}} = x_{0}^{2} \left [ \frac{\sigma ^{2}} {(\sum_{i=0}^{n} x^{2}_{i}) - N\overline{x}^{2}} \right ] + 			\frac{\sigma ^{2}}{N} + \overline{x}^{2} \left [\frac{\sigma ^{2}} {(\sum_{i=0}^{n} x^{2}_{i}) - N\overline{x}^{2}} \right 			] \\ \\
		\sigma ^{2}_{y_{0}} = \sigma ^{2} \left [ \frac{1}{N} + \frac{(\overline{x}^{2} + x^{2}_{0})}{(\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i}^{2}) - 			N\overline{x}^{2}} \right ] \\ \\
		where \quad \sigma ^{2} = \frac{1}{N-2} \sum_{i=0}^{n} (y_{i}-\hat y)^{2} \\ \\
		$
		where $ \hat y = mx_{i}+c. $
		
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The value of m obtained is \emph{22.901894357743284} and value of c is \emph{993.5137387755093}.
		\item The error in each single measurement is \emph{72.55844732036144 mm}.
		\item Linear extrapolation upto 15 degree Celsius gives an expected length of \emph{1337.0421541416586 mm}.
		\item Error in length at 15 degree Celsius is \emph{57.25523889170834 mm}.
