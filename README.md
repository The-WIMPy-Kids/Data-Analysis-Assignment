1)Codes and figures of problem 1 of the assignment can be found in the analytical branch. Topics: Contours of a bivariate_gaussian, 2D Histogram of Gaussian distributed random variables and the Histogram of a function of these variables. The plots are present in gcontour.png, ghist2D.png and ghist1D.png and the code is present in gaussw2.py

2)Codes and output screenshot and file of problem 2 have been added to the analytical branch. Code is present in pandasw2.py. The output file is panda_output.txt.

3)Code and output for 3a), 3b) and 3c) have been added to the analytical branch. Code is present in linear_expansion.py and the least square fit line in lsq.png. Note that this branch uses the analytical formulae to estimate the parameters and errors.
